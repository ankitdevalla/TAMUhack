            is to show the safety trends of the cities that are input. Data from the website comes directly from the FBI's
            official data on criminal activity. As of right now, the database is limited to Texas cities only. Our algorithm, developed
            based off the justice system and criminal punishment in the US, takes in data and spits out a score. The higher the score, the safer the city!</h4>
